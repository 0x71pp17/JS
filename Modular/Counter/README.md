# Counter App

A simple JavaScript counter

## Key Concepts Covered
- DOM selection and updating
- Event listeners
- Variable state management
- Code clarity with comments

## Usage
Open `index.html` in a browser. Click buttons to increment, decrement, or reset the counter.

## Security Context
This app does not process user input or dynamic expressions, so it avoids risks like code injection. It safely manipulates only predefined elements and values.
